	<p>Kaieteur Falls is the world's largest single drop waterfall located on the Potaro River,Region 8(Potaro-Siparuni).
	  This massive waterfall is 741 feet tall. That’s roughly four times higher than Niagara Falls in Canada, and twice as high as Victoria Falls 
	  in southern Africa. 
	  In fact, Kaieteur Falls is considered to be the largest single drop waterfall in the world—“single drop”
	  means that the water does flow over multiple tiers as it falls. Kaieteur Falls is among the world’s most breathtaking waterfalls,
      with an average of 23,400 cubic feet of water rushing over the edge every second.</p>

	  The falls plunge off the Pakaraima Mountains escarpment in an isolated western corner of Guyana only few kilometers 
	  from the Venezuelan border.The Kamarang River flows through a deep forested gorge first north- eastbound.
	  This area is remote and inhabited by the Arekuna people;
	  the river flows east through the forest until meeting the Mazaruni River at the mining village of Kamarang.
	  The height of this waterfall is 145 meters and  49 mters wide.</p>

	  River before the falls is approximately 300 m wide, it flows in majestic, wide canyon covered with pristine rainforest.
	  Mazaruni divides at the falls with an island. 
	  The main flow at the falls is approximately 400 m wide, the smaller northern arm is narrower.

	  The estimate terrain elevation above seal level is 15 metres.
	  It is approximately 5 km north of the confluence with the Potaro River.
	  It is not a gentle sort of waterfall you might see in a stately home garden, 
	  it is the kind where torrents of water are poured over rocks.
	  By nature all streams are slow-flowing, languid in pace, and lax by nature. 
	  The falls gush over the gigantic rocks. At its widest point, it is surging and plunging down the mountain.

	  It is a tributary of the Potaro River in west central Guyana.
      The water drops from the escarpment over Amaila Falls vertically approximately 200 feet (60 m), 
	  and continues in a series of rapids and falls for almost two miles before reaching placid water at an elevation of 175 feet.
	  The total drop is about 1,200 feet. This waterfall is approximately 45 m wide.
	  In the lower elevations the walls of the escarpment are flatter but these steepen sharply with

	  This waterfall ia a wide, multi-tiered series of cascades featuring plunge pools beneath 
	  the horizontal expanse of the Ireng River.These pools allowed us to swim or at least soak to cool off from the tropical heat.
	  As far as experiencing the waterfalls, Orinduik Falls allowed us to touch and feel its refreshing waters.</p>

	<p>Guyana is separated from Suriname by the Corentyne River, a river that has for over a 150 years been accepted 
	  as forming the western boundary of Suriname.A small Amerindian village is located around the river.
	  Amongst the spots to visit are the Haiwabo Creek, Mora Point, White Hill.Recreation and sporting activities are not lacking in anyway, as there is always the afternoon football
	  match before sunset that culminates with everyone taking a dip in the Corentyne river, or on the weekends when persons can have a real ‘bush cook’
	  and picnics in the jungle or just spend a day by the riverbanks.</p>

	<p>The Amerindian settlement,situated 50 miles up the Corentyne River, is no doubt leading the way in eco-tourism.Orealla 
	  “The Land of Chalk” has everything a tourist would enjoy – nature walks, sightseeing and friendly people. On a visit, you may be able to behold a jaguar in its natural habitat while enjoying the sweet succulent juice flowing from a fresh mango.The peace and tranquillity experienced on any nature walk will be interrupted temporarily by the cry of a bird escaping from its predator.One is left in awe as they marvel at the array of birds, magnificently coloured, decorating the sky.</p>
